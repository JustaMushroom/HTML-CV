  			<h3>Review</h3>
				I have always been interested in computers and computer languages and have spent
				time learning computer languages and writing computer programs. I am also interested in the medium of Anime and have been self-studying Japanese. My mother
				and step father are foster parents and I help them alongside my foster sister with
				their computer issues. In my free time I write small programs with specific uses and
				occasionally release them publicly. The biggest of which were some chat bots.<br>
				<em>I am currently based in Canterbury for University, however I am still able to reliably
				commute to positions based in or around Canterbury even outside of university
				term-time</em>
